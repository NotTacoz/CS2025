# Motivation

This is a list of resources I have compiled to get better at computer science. My goal is to ultimately expand my knowledge on how computers work, to become a better software engineer.

Despite being called a "READING list", this guide will contain many resources such as lectures and classes I find would be useful, alongside books.

My reading list will be constantly evolving and updating, as I get to know and grasp more and more CS concepts.

These resources are all from recommendations I've found online, not all of which I'd link.

Here are some links where I got the recommendations from:
