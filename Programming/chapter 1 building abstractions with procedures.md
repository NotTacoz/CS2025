First paragraph describes the 3 abilities of the brain:
1. combining several ideas into a combined one - a general overview of all patterns detected, creating a complex idea.
2. joining two ideas together, without uniting the two
3. separating complex ideas into simpler ideas, called abstraction

- **process**: abstract beings that inhabit computers, capable of manipulating *data*
	- a process is precise and accurate
- **data**: abstract beings manipulated by *processes*.
- **program**: the director of the evolution of *processes*, which is a pattern of *rules*.
- the book uses an analogy of magic:
	- a computational process == sorcerer's idea of a spirit
		- i.e. not real, not composed of matter, but it is real intellectually
- the **master software engineer** can organise programs to perform tasks intended
- they can:
	- visualise the behaviour of their *systems* in advance.
	- structure programs so unanticipated problems != really bad consequences.
	- problems are debuggable.
- this is done by designing computational systems in a *modular manner* - where each parts can be constructed, replaced, debugged separately.
	- think of different components of a website. your button, your container, your header. they are all different components and if one breaks the rest of the website can still function
